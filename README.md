# PowerShellMultitoolGui
Convert of my HTA multitool GUI for vbscripts to Powershell

This project is a 'conversion' of my HTA for vbscripts.  Primary purpose of the GUI is to facilitate powershell scripts into a gui (.net controls).  You can add powershell scripts directly or organize them into files.  Did this over the weekend so still pretty rough and not completely documented.

The GUI is designed so that you can easily modify a powershell script and use it on multiple systems and 'sorta' organize them from a dropdown list control using name space like naming to order them.  The GUI is designed to display the code in a text control so that they can be modified and then executed on a list of targets.  Targets can be systems or other objects you wish to apply the powershell code too.

That's it for now.  Will put up more info as time permits.
